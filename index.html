		<p style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;">I started doing yoga about 4 years ago. A few years into yoga I had a wrist injury (from other causes). The doctors told me I would never practice yoga again. I became really depressed and felt hopeless. Fitness was my passion and it appeared I would never be able to pursue it to its full potential. I started practicing yoga with hopes I would eventually be able to use my wrist again. With proper training and continual practice I am happy to say I have complete use of my wrist again! This was my jumpstart to yogaYoga has not only changed my physical side but it has helped me to connect with myself on a much deeper level.   Every day when I show up to my mat is the best part of my day! Yoga has become my passion and now I want to share that with the world. I have practiced all forms of yoga including; hatha, vinyasa, ashtanga, retorative, and kundalini. I love doing inversions, and any pose that challenges me. My hobbies outside of yoga include traveling, hiking, scuba diving, and adventure sports. Most importantly I enjoy sharing her passion for yoga with others</p>
